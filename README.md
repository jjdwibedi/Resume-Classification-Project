******Problem Statement******
The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning system that can automatically classify resumes into different categories based on their content. The manual process of reviewing and categorizing resumes is time-consuming and prone to errors, especially when dealing with a large volume of resumes. By automating this task, we can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of resume screening processes for job applications.

The system should be able to extract relevant information from resumes, such as job titles, skills, experience levels, or industry domains, and assign appropriate categories to each resume. This will enable recruiters and HR professionals to quickly filter and prioritize resumes based on their specific requirements.

The key challenges in this project include handling the variability in resume formats, extracting meaningful features from unstructured text data, and building a robust classification model that can generalize well to unseen resumes. The system should be scalable, adaptable to different industries and job markets, and capable of handling a diverse range of resumes.

The success of this project will be measured by the accuracy and efficiency of the resume classification system. The model should achieve high classification accuracy on a representative dataset of resumes and demonstrate the ability to handle new resumes with consistent performance.
